# CLI design

authors: @toumorokoshi, @zph


This proposal outlines the design decisions and considerations for the Tome CLI.

## Background

Tome was initially designed as a drop-in replacement for [sub](https://github.com/basecamp/sub), to ensure portability.

## Terminology

For the following discussion, `{instance}` is defined as the instantiated tome (autogenerated shell function wrapping tome) or sub command.

## Design Decisions

### compatibility with sub CLI instances

Sub-based clis provide the following functionality with each command:

- `{instance} --help`: a list of all known commands, and a description.
- `{instance} help {subcommand}`: a help guide on the subcommand.

### reserving a namespace for tome to add to instanced CLIs

Since a user can name their commands after any valid filename, it is possible
for any command that is built into the tome-based CLIs to clobber a possible command the user would like to create.

For example let's assume that tome would like to introduce a top-level command known as "exec". This would look like:

```
{instance} exec
```

However, this could conflict with a user creating a file called `exec` in their instance root directory.

Due to this possibility, tome cannot easily add new commands to the root, and must declare the set of reserved top-level names, or reserve none at all.

However, it is valuable for time to add new commands in the CLI themselves, as tome gains more functionality. So we should provide a *pattern* for how new commands are introduced.

A couple options include:

- only use flags to denote subcommands. a la `{instance} --help`.
- provide a reserved namespace in which tome can add commands. For example `{instance} tome help`.

### commands available to tome itself

The tome CLI is only restricted by backwards compatibility with regards to the design of the CLI. As such, we can liberally add commands to the tome CLI.
